The [Making & Knowing Project](https://www.makingandknowing.org), founded in 2014 by Pamela H. Smith, and involving hundreds of collaborators, is a research and pedagogical initiative in the [Center for Science and Society](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org) at Columbia University.

As a postdoctoral fellow, I took part in the project working, among other things, on the [digital critical edition](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org) of BnF Ms. Fr. 640. This unique 16th-century French manuscript offers first-hand insight into making and materials from a time when artists were scientists.  

The digital edition makes an abundance of data freely available on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data). Over the next year, I intend to publish a series of blog posts related to the edition and its data. I will show how easily one can download and analyze the text using Python or R. Stay tuned!
