Autonomous systems, fueled by AI, are multiplying economic output while concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. The United States, bastion of capitalism, illustrates how these gains accrue to big-tech oligarchs, echoing a Marxian endgame of concentrated capital. Meanwhile, China’s top-down governance sees fit to humble its own tech barons, keeping potential oligarchs on a tight leash. Iron-fisted methods aside, Beijing’s model might enable wider sharing of AI’s spoils—something liberal democracies have yet to accomplish.

For those who champion liberal democracies, this dynamic poses an existential question: Can we reform our markets to ensure robots enrich the many, not just the powerful? Without strategic regulation, liberal democracies risk sliding into *de facto* oligarchies where money dictates policy. The irony of our era could be a communist triumph, not through revolution, but via an authoritarian system that disciplines its tycoons and enforces a more equitable distribution of wealth.

One needn’t endorse Beijing’s methods to see the grim reality: If democracies fail to confront the problem of runaway inequality, the 21st century may well prove Marx correct. The real challenge, then, is to harness our faith in iolitical freedom and deploy it to reshape capitalism—before history’s pendulum swings decisively away from liberal democracy.
